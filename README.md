# Monopoly Simulator

A Monte Carlo simulation of the game Monopoly, written in Python.

We attempt to simulate as much of the game as possible, tracking various data
e.g. player money.

## Notes on rules

- The bank has unlimited money. During normal play, you are encouraged to
  create your own bank notes from paper if the bank runs out of money.
- The Free Parking space does nothing. Many people play a variation of Monopoly
  where fees paid to the bank get added to a pot, and a player wins the pot
  when they land on Free Parking. However, this is not an official rule, and it
  only tends to make the game longer, so it has been omitted here.
